== Intro

This plugin is a fork of the localized_country_select plugin available at http://github.com/karmi/localized_country_select.

Only minors changes have been done to be compliant with the former select_country from Rails. It allows this plugin to be 
used with the Formtastic gem (see in the "example" section) to provide 1/ localized countries and 2/ country codes stored in the DB (instead of country name). 


= LocalizedCountrySelect

Rails plugin to provide support for localized <tt><select></tt> menu with country names and for
storing country information as country _code_ (eg. 'es'), not _name_ (eg. 'Spain'), in the database.

Uses the Rails internationalization framework (I18n, http://rails-i18n.org) for translating the names of countries.
Requires Rails 2.2 (released November 21st, 2008) or later versions.
Country names are loaded from hashes in plugin directory, according to <tt>I18n.locale</tt> value.

You can easily translate country codes in your application like this:

    <%= I18n.t @user.country, :scope => 'countries' %>

Comes with a Rake task <tt>rake import:country_select 'de'</tt> for importing country names
from Unicode.org's CLDR repository (http://www.unicode.org/cldr/data/charts/summary/root.html)
Don't forget to restart the application when you add new locale.

ActionView helper code is adapted from Rails' default +country_select+ plugin (previously in core).
See http://github.com/rails/country_select/tree/master/lib/country_select.rb

== Example

    <%= localized_country_select(:user, :country, [], :include_blank => 'Please choose...') %>

will become:
    
    <select name="user[country]" id="user_country">
    <option value="">Please choose...</option>
    <option disabled="disabled" value="">-------------</option>
    <option value="AF">Afghanistan</option>
    ...
    <option value="ZW">Zimbabwe</option>
    </select>

for the <tt>en</tt> locale.

To use this plugin with Formtastic:

For a model which has a country_code attribute:
<%= form.input :country_code, :as => :country, :priority_countries => ['fr', 'it', 'be'] %>
